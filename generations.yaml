    description: "The original Nissan Juke introduced a distinctively polarizing design to the emerging subcompact crossover segment, featuring bulbous fenders, a coupe-like roofline, raised ground clearance, and unusual split front lighting with round headlights below LED daytime running lights at the hood level. Built on Nissan's B-platform shared with the Versa/Micra, it offered compact exterior dimensions with a more car-like driving position than many crossovers. In North America, power came exclusively from a 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 188 horsepower, paired with either a CVT or 6-speed manual transmission and available with front-wheel or torque-vectoring all-wheel drive. The interior featured a motorcycle-inspired console, distinctive circular gauges, and available colored trim accents, though rear seat and cargo space were limited by the dramatic styling. A high-performance NISMO variant was introduced in 2013 with increased power output (up to 215 hp in the NISMO RS), sport-tuned suspension, and unique styling elements. The limited-production Juke-R featured the GT-R's powertrain and running gear in a modified Juke body. A mild refresh in 2015 brought updated styling and features. The first-generation Juke helped establish the subcompact crossover segment and attracted younger buyers to the Nissan brand with its unconventional design and engaging driving dynamics, though its polarizing styling and practical compromises limited its mainstream appeal."

  - name: "Second Generation (F16)"
    start_year: 2020
    end_year: null
    description: "The second-generation Juke maintains its predecessor's distinctive character but with a more refined interpretation of its unique styling. Built on the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance's CMF-B platform shared with the Renault Captur, it features a coupe-like silhouette with slim LED headlights, prominent circular running lights, hidden rear door handles, and a floating roof design. Despite similar exterior dimensions to its predecessor, interior space is significantly improved with increased rear seat legroom and cargo capacity. In most markets, power comes from a 1.0L turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing approximately 117 horsepower, paired with either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission, primarily in front-wheel drive configuration with all-wheel drive available in select markets. Some regions also offer a hybrid powertrain combining a 1.6L gasoline engine with an electric motor. The interior represents a major upgrade with higher quality materials, more conventional ergonomics, and modern technology including an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, available Bose Personal Plus audio system with headrest speakers, and a comprehensive suite of Nissan Safety Shield driver assistance features. The second-generation Juke refines the model's formula with more mainstream appeal through improved practicality and technology while maintaining distinctive styling to stand out in the increasingly crowded subcompact crossover segment. Unlike the first generation, this model is not offered in North America, where it's effectively replaced by the more conventional Kicks."
